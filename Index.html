     <h2>About this website</h2>
     <p>Hi there, everyone.
         My name's Mann, I'm a graphic designer and soon to be a developer and 
         I'm pretty excited about it. Learning html and css cause it's gonna help me
         with Shopify developing since it mainly requires HTML and a little bit of css 
         and for Liquid, I'll watch a few vids by Shopify devs. Should be easy, let's see
         how fast I can learn all this and start developing websites and shopify stores. 
         Till then, see ya!! :D
